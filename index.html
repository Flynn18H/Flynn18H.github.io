<p1>Warrior/Melee is the most generic of them all but also the best throughout the playthrough, This is normally everyones first playthrough class, as all weapons and armor are quite simple to get. Warior is known to be the best class as all of his armor is strong and all his weapons do a lot of damage, in the 1.3 update the developers added yoyo's, yoyo's fall under melee damage, this allowed Warrior to have more range while still doing a lot of damage to creatures.</p1>
    
    <!--second class, ranger/range-->

<p2>Ranger class tends to stay balanced throughout the entire playthrough, Ranger isnt overpowered towards endgame but he is defiently not weak and you will most likely know this throughout your playthrough. </p2>
    
    <!--third class, sorcerer/mage-->

<p3>Mage is a class that starts off pretty weak but towards endgame mage has a massive power spike and I think mage is one of the funniest classes to play as all the weapons feel a lot more different and unique.</p3>
    
    <!--fourth class, summoner-->

<p4>Summoner is easily the weakest classes in the game there is no point where summoner is better than the other classes, but summoner is quite fun to play, as you have to rely on your summons to fight for you.</p4>
